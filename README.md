Cheers!

My name's Michael. Friends call me Cooper.

In May 2016, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a BA in Computer Science.

I'm drawn to the creative aspect of programming. The idea that if you write the correct lines of code, you can realize pretty much anything you can think up.

It's an exciting time in the field of computer science!
